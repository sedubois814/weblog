<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
	This is my first attempt at creating a fully functional website 
	using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This 
	site was created following the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
	Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
